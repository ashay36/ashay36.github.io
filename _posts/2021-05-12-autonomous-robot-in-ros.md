The project includes a robot being spawned in a restaurant world. The robot travels autonomously around the restaurant using the map developed using SLAM and by control commands generated by move_base package in ROS which uses the RRT algorithm for path plannning.

### To run the code in your machine, following are the steps :- 
1. Close the repository in your machine.
2. Copy the packages in your workspace.
3. Terminal 1 - catkin_make
4. Terminal 1 - source devel/setup.bash
5. Terminal 1 - roslaunch path_planning simulation.launch
6. Terminal 2 - roslaunch path_planning plan_path.launch
7. Give a goal location using "2D Nav Goal" option in RViz
